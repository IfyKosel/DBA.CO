The same price is obviously different because if it is a transportation that uses vehicles such as airplanes, it will use fuel at a high price, so it is very expensive and the delivery time is much faster, but due to the high price, it uses much less service than other types, and car transportation is also less transit time than airplanes but faster than ships, but until delivery is minimal, and boats are the most used type of service, although it takes slower transportation time than all types, but with a low price and a lot of cargo, it is the most popular nowadays.</p>
